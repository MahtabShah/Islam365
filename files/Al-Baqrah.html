            <p>[Baqarah 2:2] This is the exalted Book (the Qur’an), in which there is no place for doubt; a guidance for the pious.</p>

            <p>[Baqarah 2:6] As for those whose fate is disbelief, whether you warn them or do not warn them - it is all one for them; they will not believe. (Because their hearts are sealed - see next verse).</p>
